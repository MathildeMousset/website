<p>I did not have time to explore milk consuption in the USA last week, and this week #TidyTuesday dataset does not really ignites my curiosity. But I would like to learn a little more about delays and cancellation of High Speed Trains in France.</p>

<p>Likely out of pure pettiness<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>So for my non-canon #Tidytuesday, carry on the work from the previous post and explore a dataset per line between towns (what the SNCF call “links”, or liaison in French). This dataset gives the detail of the number of trains, number of cancelled trains and number of late trains between to given stations, so it’s going to be fun to see which lines and stations suffer from most delay.</p>
<p>Originally, for this post, I wanted to map the data on a French map, but I encountered a bit of trouble in getting the GPS coordinates of the stations, and I am still perfecting my fuzzyjoining<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. This might be a story for later, including the crushing of my cute naivety concerning name harmonizing in datasets made available within the same company.</p>
<div id="the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>The data</h1>
<p>The dataset were downloaded on the 1st of February 2019 on the <a href="https://ressources.data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/regularite-mensuelle-tgv-aqst/export/?sort=nombre_de_trains_annules&amp;q=gare&amp;dataChart=eyJxdWVyaWVzIjpbeyJjaGFydHMiOlt7InR5cGUiOiJzcGxpbmUiLCJmdW5jIjoiQVZHIiwieUF4aXMiOiJleHRlcm5lcyIsInNjaWVudGlmaWNEaXNwbGF5Ijp0cnVlLCJjb2xvciI6IiNhNmQ4NTQifV0sInhBeGlzIjoicGVyaW9kZSIsIm1heHBvaW50cyI6IiIsInRpbWVzY2FsZSI6Im1vbnRoIiwic29ydCI6IiIsImNvbmZpZyI6eyJkYXRhc2V0IjoicmVndWxhcml0ZS1tZW5zdWVsbGUtdGd2LWFxc3QiLCJvcHRpb25zIjp7InNvcnQiOiJub21icmVfZGVfdHJhaW5zX2FubnVsZXMifX19XSwidGltZXNjYWxlIjoiIiwiZGlzcGxheUxlZ2VuZCI6dHJ1ZSwiYWxpZ25Nb250aCI6dHJ1ZX0%3D">Open Data of the French train company</a>.</p>
<p>The dataframe contains information on the number of trains, cancelled trains and delayed trains between two stations (links) for each month from 2015 to 2018.</p>
<p>The SNCF has several ways of quantifying train delays.</p>
<p>The <strong>punctuality</strong> is the number of trains that left on time at their departure station, over all trains that left this station on the perimeter. So here, punctuality is expressed in <em>percentage</em> of trains that departed <strong>that month</strong> and <strong>on this link</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>regularity</strong> is the number of trains that arrived <em>on time</em> at the <strong>terminus</strong> of the line over the number of trains that ran on the whole line.</p>
<p>A train can be counted in several “links”, but will be counted only once for the regularity. For example, let’s consider a (simplifed) line between Paris and Montpellier, with an intermediate stop in Lyon. <em>Paris - Lyon</em> is one link, <em>Lyon - Montpellier</em> is another link. A train leaving late from Paris will thus be counted as late in the <em>Paris - Lyon</em> link, and also in the <em>Lyon - Montpellier</em> link. However, it will be counted only once for the estimation of the regularity, which is fair if one wants national data on cumulative delay over the whole line. I am, however, interested in the distribution of delay over links, so we will not discuss the <em>regularity</em> here.</p>
<div id="technical-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Technical information</h2>
<p>Here, trip_duration is the expected duration of the trip in min.</p>
<p>The dataset provides some information on the source of delay. Here is the classification:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>External causes</em>: delay due to external problems (e.g. bad wheather, obstacles on train tracks, suspicious luggage (aka the-forgotten-luggage-of-doom-that-could-be-a-bomb), material destruction, strike etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Railway infrastructure</em>: maintenance, work on the railway network</p></li>
<li><p><em>Traffic management</em>: problems in managing the rail traffic, in connecting the different networks. Which network (car network? TGV / Intercité network), I have no idea.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Driving meterial</em>: I suppose that it means that there was a problem on the train itself (as opposed to rail or other aspect of infrastructure).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Station</em>: delays due to station management and re-use of material. I suppose this encompasses the people (as in the driver is sick?) and waiting for a train that is late and need to be used for another trip.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Users</em>: delays due to having to deal with users (too many users, trying to ensure a connection)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, on a totally unrelated note, todays’s colors come rom the very cute <code>wesanderson</code> package. Because I can.</p>

<div id="data-wrangling" class="section level1">
<h1>Data wrangling</h1>
<p>I will first sort the dates (turn them in ordered factors).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Make year as ordered factor
tgv$year_ordered = factor(tgv$year, ordered = TRUE)

# Get months in English
tgv$month_english = factor(tgv$month_number, ordered = TRUE)
levels(tgv$month_english) &lt;- c(&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;,  &quot;October&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then put the stations in title case, with the <code>str_to_title</code> function, because it’s prettier.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tgv &lt;- mutate(tgv, 
              departure_station = str_to_title(departure_station),
              arrival_station = str_to_title(arrival_station))</code></pre>
<p>I will then make a departure and an arrival dataset, to simplify things.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tgv &lt;- tgv %&gt;% 
  mutate(nb_trains = expected_nb_trains - nb_cancelled_trains)

<div id="cancelled-trains" class="section level1">

<p>We can see that in general, there are a less than fifty trains cancelled per link and per month, but there is an impressive tail of links that had a huge number of trains cancelled some months. Even if they were links with many trains running, more than 100 cancelled seems a lot.</p>

<p>Wow, the effect of the month-long strike of 2018 is very, <em>very</em> clear. And there seem to be a lot of cancellation in 2016 too.</p>
<p>According to the open data of the <a href="%22https://www.ouest-france.fr/economie/transports/sncf/infographies-sncf-depuis-1947-pas-une-annee-sans-mouvement-social-5621071%22">SNCF</a>, 2016 was one of the 10 biggest strike since 1947.</p>
<p>The data for 2018 is not yet in the <a href="%22https://data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/mouvements-sociaux-depuis-1947/table/?sort=date&amp;dataChart=eyJ0aW1lc2NhbGUiOiIiLCJxdWVyaWVzIjpbeyJ4QXhpcyI6ImRhdGUiLCJzb3J0IjoiIiwibWF4cG9pbnRzIjoiIiwiY2hhcnRzIjpbeyJ5QXhpcyI6ImpvdXJuZWVzX3BlcmR1ZXMiLCJmdW5jIjoiU1VNIiwiY29sb3IiOiIjNjZjMmE1IiwidHlwZSI6InNwbGluZSIsInNjaWVudGlmaWNEaXNwbGF5Ijp0cnVlfV0sInRpbWVzY2FsZSI6InllYXIiLCJjb25maWciOnsiZGF0YXNldCI6Im1vdXZlbWVudHMtc29jaWF1eC1kZXB1aXMtMTk0NyIsIm9wdGlvbnMiOnsic29ydCI6ImRhdGUifX0sInNlcmllc0JyZWFrZG93biI6IiIsInNlcmllc0JyZWFrZG93blRpbWVzY2FsZSI6IiJ9XSwiZGlzcGxheUxlZ2VuZCI6dHJ1ZSwiYWxpZ25Nb250aCI6dHJ1ZX0%3D%22">SNCF open data about strikes</a> but 2018 will remain in the French memory<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> as the 3 months long strike, the longest in the past 30 years. So it is not suprising that 2018 is a bad year in terms of train cancellation. Taking train was hell (M. Mousset, personnal observation).</p>

<p>We can see two things. First, the stations with the greatest number of trains are pretty much in the middle of the other stations in terms of cancellation. So the cancellation do not result from just a huge service (and the likely technical problems associated with managing train and people at a bigger scale).</p>
<p>We can also see that Madrid has a pretty bad reccord here, as well as Marnes la Vallee. However, we saw previously that we only have data in 2018 for these stations, and that 2018 was a weird year. Let’s see what happens if we focus on the years 2015-2017.</p>

<p>The first two stations are Nice and Toulon, in the PACA region (South-Est of France). I expected Marseille to be with them (from regular complaining from users), but it is not. And Montpellier is the fourth, despite me having never had a cancelled train in many years of use. Which goes to remind us that data is better than impressions and wild guess, if anybody needed the reminder.</p>

<p>So Toulon is fifth on the list of rate of delayed trains. It seems that the picture is a bit different for cancellation and delay. I supposed that this makes sense as I don’t think cancellation ad delay usually arrise because of the same problems.</p>

<p>Yes, in some stations, some months, 100% were late to some extent, I checked.</p>
<p>Curiously, the strike in 2018 was associated with smaller delays in May and June: a lot of trains were cancelled, but the one actually runing were relatively more on time. Which makes sense: less traffic on the line, less people attempting to get the train, more trains to choose from (so perhaps lower rates of technical problems, ot at least plenty of replacment options to choose from) etc.</p>

<p>So it seems that the station Marne la Vallée has high rates of delay (nothing we have not seen before), but the the pecentage of delayed trains at the other end of the links is much lower (at least for Lyon Part Dieu, and Marseille). Globally, it seems that trains manage to catch up delay between Lyon and Marnes. Which makes sense because if they don’t stop at Creusot, there is a long straight patch where they can gain and maintain speed.</p>

<p>Well, this is still not highly informative I am afraid. Some stations have patches of rough time (maybe because of works within the station or on the rails close to the station), and there seem to be small differences between station, but nothing extaordinary catches my eye.</p>
