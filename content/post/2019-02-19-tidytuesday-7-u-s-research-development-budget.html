<p>This week <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-02-12">Tidytuesday’s data</a> concern US research and development budget. Three files were provided, with budget data for Research &amp; Development, climate and energy. This dataset was originally collected by the <a href="%22https://www.aaas.org/%22">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>.</p>
<p>I will focus on the R&amp;D budget. I wish to know which agencies get the highest funding, and how research funding evolved in the past 40 years. I kind of suspect that they decreased, and I would like to check whether that’s true.</p>
<p>Today’s exploration will be quite simple, and I will use mostly <code>dplyr</code> to summarise data per agencies, and <code>ggplot2</code> to plot things. A little trick, though is the package <code>scales</code> that is used to write percentage signs on the plot axis.</p>
<p>And I use the <code>hrbrthemes</code> for the beautiful themes. One day I will make my own professional-looking theme. One day…</p>
<p>First we import the data directly from Github.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-02-12/fed_r_d_spending.csv&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(rd_budget_billion = rd_budget/(10^9)) -&gt; feder_spendings</code></pre>
<p>We have a first look at the structure of the data. The data.frame is pretty straightforward:<br />
- <code>department</code> the abbreviated name of the federal agencies<br />
- <code>year</code><br />
- <code>rd_budget</code> the budget for research and development - <code>total_outlays</code> the money actually paid out by the U.S. Treasury<br />
- <code>GDP</code> the Gross Domestic Product, which represent the US economy<br />
- <code>discretionary_outlays</code> represent the part of the budget that pays for governmental programs. These spending levels are set each year by Congress. Yes, I had check the <a href="%22https://www.nationalpriorities.org/budget-basics/federal-budget-101/spending/%22">meaning</a>…</p>
<p>I also created a column with the R&amp;D budget in billions, because it makes numbers easier to grasp.</p>

<h2>Total R&amp;D budget</h2>
<p>Since we are dealing with data through time, and with 14 categories, two types of visualization jumped directly to my mind: a heat map and a line plot. Both of them are pretty easy to make with <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>
<p>From the heat map, what is obvious is that some agencies receive far more money than some others. <strong>DOD</strong> stands for the department of defence, and it seemed to be the singlets most funded agency, which anybody with even a varnish of history knowledge about the U.S. would expect. <strong>NASA</strong> also have high funding, which is not totally surprising, especially given the data on Space Launches that we explored for #Tidytuesday week 3. The two remaining agencies that stand out, <strong>HHS</strong> and <strong>DOE</strong> perform health research.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>feder_spendings %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = department, y = year, 
             fill = rd_budget_billion)) +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(title = &quot;R&amp;D budget per agency and year&quot;,
       y = &quot;Year&quot;,
       x = &quot;Federal agency&quot;,
       fill = &quot;Inlfation adjusted budget\n(billion $)&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;Department (DOD), health (NIH, HHS) and energy (DOE) \nhave the highest funding...&quot;,
       caption = &quot;Source data: American Association for the Advancement of Science\nInflation adjusted dollars&quot;) +

<p>Because of the huge variation of funding between agencies, the heat map representation limits us in seeing the finer patterns. So let’s go back to good old line graphs. Since we already know which agencies are the most funded, I make a plot by agency, with free scale on the <em>y</em> axis.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>feder_spendings %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes( x = year, y = rd_budget_billion, 
              colour = department, 
              fill   = department)) +
  facet_wrap(~department, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, ncol = 3) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  
  labs(title = &quot;R&amp;D budget per agency and year&quot;,
       x = &quot;Year&quot;,
       y = &quot;Inflation-adjusted budget (billion $)&quot;,
       colour = &quot;&quot;,
       caption = &quot;Source data: American Association for the Advancement of Science&quot;) +

  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;,
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        strip.text = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;))</code></pre>

<p>We can see that the budget of defence has steadily risen, with a bump in after year 2000. <strong>NASA</strong> budget was brutally reduced during the mid-eighties, but recovered and has been mostly stable since.The <strong>NIH</strong> and <strong>NSF</strong> budget have slowly increased over years, although <strong>NIH</strong> is now stagnating.</p>

<div id="rd-budget-relative-to-total-federal-budget" class="section level2">
<h2>R&amp;D budget relative to total federal budget</h2>
<p>Now, let’s have a look at how much percent of the total federal budget is invested in these agencies. This informs us on the politic decisions on budget allocation between the different services.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>feder_spendings %&gt;% 
  # Get proportion of budget
  mutate(rd_rate = rd_budget / total_outlays) %&gt;% 
  # Plot
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rd_rate, 
             colour = department, 
             fill   = department)) +
  facet_wrap(~department, scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, ncol = 3) +
  
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  
  labs(title = &quot;Percentage of total federal budget invested in R&amp;D in the USA&quot;,
       y = &quot;Year&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;...but massive decrease of R&amp;D funding over years (relative to total budget)&quot;,
       x = &quot;Percentage of US budget&quot;,
       caption = &quot;Source data: American Association for the Advancement of Science&quot;) +
  
  scale_colour_viridis_d(option = &quot;inferno&quot;) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = &quot;inferno&quot;) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +

  theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;,
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),

<p><img src="/post/2019-02-19-tidytuesday-7-u-s-research-development-budget_files/figure-html/lines_2-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>Clearly, the decision has been to decrease investment in R&amp;D over all agencies, and thus all thematics.</p>
</div>
<div id="rd-budget-relative-to-gdp" class="section level2">
<h2>R&amp;D budget relative to GDP</h2>
<p>If we now investigate what the different budget represent compared to the GDP of the U.S.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>feder_spendings %&gt;%

       colour = &quot;&quot;,

<p>In recent years, the budget invested in research and development, compared to the GDP has been decreasing for pretty much all agencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="cumulative-rd-budget-over-years" class="section level1">
<h1>Cumulative R&amp;D budget over years</h1>
<p>If we add the total amount of money invested in R&amp;D fr each agencies over the forty years:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Sum the budget and R&amp;D budget per agency over all years, and then take the proportion invested in R&amp;D
feder_spendings %&gt;% 
  group_by(department) %&gt;% 
  summarise(total_founded = sum(rd_budget, na.rm = TRUE),
            total_budget  = sum(total_outlays, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% 
  mutate(total_founded_billions = total_founded / (10^9),
         rd_rate = total_founded/total_budget,
         department = fct_reorder(department, rd_rate)) -&gt; feder_total</code></pre>
<p>Here again, we can see that the U.S. invested a <em>huge</em> amount of money in R&amp;D for defence (over 2500 billion $) over the years. I cannot even understand what that sum of money means. They invested a bit less than 2000 billion $ in health.</p>
